# Everything Is Awesome May 2025 Robot Hackathon repository

> [!NOTE]
>
> This is a fork of the main Monty project used in the May 2025 Hackathon. For the up-to-date Monty project, please see the main repository: https://github.com/thousandbrainsproject/tbp.monty

This is our code for the May 2025 Robot Hackathon repository. We took the fork approach, so all of the Monty code at the time is included in this repository, with some infrastructure and documentation deleted.

## Project Overview

We built a LEGO robot that could orbit around an object, learn the object, and later, recognize the object.
